autoload
    naming convention: ???.vim
    Vim provides a mechanism to ensure that startup time isn't compromised
    when large scripts are loaded. Functions, commands and mappings defined
    in the autoload directory are defined with an empty implementation on
    startup. It is only when these commands are invoked by the user that the
    script is sourced in full, and each command is attached to its
    implementation.
